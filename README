Avocado is a PHP library which handles two database differences, written with OOP and TDD in mind

DETAIL:
	Avocado will provide a simple interface to:
		* Manage Rails-style migrations
		* Auto-create migrations and raw sql from the differences of the current
		  schema and the previous version

ROADMAP:
	* Handle indexes, field/table encoding
	* Handle other MySQL-specific field/table properties (AUTO_INCREMENT, database engine, etc)
	* Automatic schema migration: generate diff between current schema and the previous
	  version or older, generate SQL and do schema migration
	* Interactive CLI frontend
	* Database agnostic
