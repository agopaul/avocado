Avocado is a PHP library which handles two database differences, written with OOP and TDD in mind

DETAIL:
	Avocado will provide a simple interface to:
		* Manage Rails-style migrations
		* Auto-create migrations and raw sql from the differences of 
		  two existing schemas, in order to upgrade legacy dbs

ROADMAP:
	* Semiautomatic schema migration
	* Database agnostic
	* Web frontend
	* Cli frontend, interactive/full-automatic
	* Strong compatibility with PHP 5.1
